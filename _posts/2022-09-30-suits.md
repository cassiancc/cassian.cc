Amazing show at [Suits That Rock 2022](https://thecarnegie.com/support/suits-that-rock/). Dad helped to raise $175,000 for The Carnegie's childrens education program (oh, and got to play in front of a sold out crowd of 1,200 people!)<!--more-->

Suits happens every year, so if you like rock and roll, definitely consider coming by next year.
